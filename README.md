# RESTAURANT STAGE 1 PROJECT

My version of Udacity's Front-End Web Development final project utilizing everything used in the course: HTML, CSS, the DOM, and JavaScript and adding ServiceWorker and accessibility features to the mix. This project was essentially a mock customer request to perform an entire webpage redesign.

## How To Install

1. Download my project off of GitHub (Either manually or via forking)
2. Startup a local server. See here if you don't know how: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server>
3. Look around and test the website caching in offline mode.

## Post Mortem

This project was extremely time consuming and I had a ton of trouble learning the Service Worker code portion. However, this project is truly a project for a portfolio and like everything else in this course I learned a lot.
